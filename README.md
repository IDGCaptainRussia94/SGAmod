Changelog:

2.20-(2/27/20)-Patch #2:

--Added:
-Acid Scepter, Flail-O-Nades,Demon Steppers, Bundle of Javelin Spear Heads and Javelin Parts, Corroded Shield and Amber Glow Skull (Spider Queen Expert Drop and bonus Drop respectively), Cursed Hail, Massacre Prototype, Heartreach/Booster/Omni Magnets
-A few more chat lines, as well as a hint to how to easily get more of the custom ammo types
-Crafting recipes for the SandStorm in a Bottle, Flying Carpet, Slime Staff, and Shark Tooth Necklace
--Changed:
-Opening a Terraria Co Supply Crate now has a chance to drop a Gold Ring, Lucky Coin, and Discount Card
-recipe changes for Bundle of Javelin Bases, Prismal Ore, and Luminary Wings
-Blazewyrm's set bonus explosion has been changed, mostly nerfed
-Omega Sigil is now an accessory, might be overpowered, let me know
-Buffed XOP FlameThrower: Does not cause immunity frames with other projectiles
-Buffed Mudrock Crasher: which got a rework-Nerfed SBC Cannon/Mk2: SBC Cannonballs don't crit, crits on the SBC Cannon and MK2 were honestly way too overpowered given the weapons' low rate of fire and very high damage, however, they ignore enemy immunity frames and the explosion CAN crit
-Spider Queen's Acid Venom has been buffed to do a type of debuff splash damage, this applies to player projectiles too
-Cosmic Cocktail has been reworked-it now ignores immunity frames, projectiles do variable damage, and is slower and does less base damage
-True Moonlight's projectiles hit slightly slower and penetrate less, the movement speed of said projectiles doesn't change, and the weapon charges faster with a quick melee swing speed, Lv3 Slashwave hits less often and homes from a greater distance
-Assassin and Elite Emblem have been reworked as the Omni-Magnet now uses the grab bonus
-Novus, Notchvus, and Dosed arrows have had their homing adjusted
-Starfish Burster's and Starfish Blaster's Starfish projectiles all hit on a target

--Fixed:
-Spider Queen not dropping any Gold
-Accessories that were stackable
-Not really a fix, but updating framework for 1.4, so grenades don't end up doing ranged damage when the update comes
-Being able to Dos enemies in gas who were already combusted
-The F.S.R.G not being able to get crits
-True Moonlight and Surt, the projectiles don't interfer with the melee hits anymore
-Star Burster and Starfish-Burster taking mana when you have no ammo left
-Optimized Homing Arrow code a bit, should lead to better FPS with alot of enemies on screen
-Other smaller bugs

2.11-(2/24/20)-Patch #1b:

This version is the same as below, but I was running into a MariaDB error that kept me from posting, and was debugging it.

2.10-(2/24/20)-Patch #1:

--Changed:
-When Calamity is installed-Doom Harbinger and Surpreme Pinky will automatically force Revengence and Death mode off, this is due to a critical conflict between the mods during these fights
-Enhancing Charm turned out to be alot stronger than it said it was and has been nerfed accordingly
-Normal Difficulty now only gives you 80% of the Expertise when rewarded, while expert mode gives the full ammount
-Removed Draken's lines that talk about him being sorry to Val, because he's not anymore
-Reverse Engineering Station's crafting recipe has been changed a bit, as well as a few other items, but nothing pace breaking
-Lined-out some tooltips to shorten them being too long on lower resolutions
-Crafting recipes for the Heart Lantern and Star in a Bottle Pets have been altered
-Added Glow Masks for a quite a few weapons


--Fixed:
-HOPEFULLY fixed the Sword Shrines getting deleted by generation (atleast the annoying ones, like traps)
-Cosmillash and Beam Gun now do variable damage where they didn't do any before
-Fixed soft-locking issues with the Grenadier's Glove and speed-related modifiers (upped value worth a bit more too to make reforging less cheap)
-Fixed Virulent and Mangrove item crafting issues and adjusted them to require Dank Wood (where needed)
-I forgot to mention a weapon the previous version added- the Circuit Breaker Blade, so yeah, whoops, also updating how I do changelogs numbers by also adding dates.
-A possible issue with Massive Bleeding and Gourged setting the buff type to a different buff
-Typoes and a few other things


2.0-(2/22/20)-Caliburn's Gifts:
--A majorish-sorta update for you! 3 Caliburn Alters can now be found on new worlds, they each contain a strong pre-hardmode sword, at a price... But it will be worth it for their true form.

--Added the Dank Shrines-a series of 3 mini dungeons brimmed with traps, but with great rewards for those willing to take the challange, can you find all 3 in your world? (Hint-entry point is near the tops, swords are near the bottom, usually)
--Added the Caliburn Trio and their upgrade: True Caliburn
--Added Onyx Tactical Shotgun, Automatic SMG Rifle, Tesla Staff, Circuit Breaker Blade, and Gatlipillar
--Added the Dank Compass to Draken's shop
--Added Dank Wood, Items, and Armor, you can find what you need in Dank Shrine Chests, and when you run out, you can fish em up in there!
--Added a new (mini)Boss-The Spirit of Caliburn, those swords won't come free, you'll need to prove your mettle first
--Added 2 light pets
--Added Revamped Trap Damage system
--Added Prefixes for trap-related items, as well as releated to throwing items and accessories!
--The Grenadier's Glove and Primordial Skull gained a new a passive ability
--Ice Scepter got an alt fire
--Expertise cap is now 16000 (before was 15000)

--Changed:
-The way the HUD above the player is drawn, it is no longer a player layer, but rather an overlay
-XOP Flamethrower's flames can no longer exist going into water, and die like lava rocks do on touching it
-Enemies who are immune to bleeding are now also immune to Massive Bleeding and Gourged
-Updated the tooltip for Havoc's Fragmented Remains
-Added Treepeater tooltip to mention how fast the projectile is.
-Reduced speed of Cosmic Cocktail when thrown by hand, added a tip to the Grenadier's Glove
-Altered some items' crafting recipes
-Buffed Sword of a Thousand Truths, is no longer expert only, is now sold by Draken post-Cratrosity
-Nerfed TPS's boss fight, but made the predicted aim of lasers properly... uh, aim. Also nerfed Cratrosity's attacks.
-Nerfed Flame-Trap Thrower and HeatBeater
-Buffed Super Dart Trap 'gun'
-Buffed Sharkvern-his body segments have 75% DR now
-Buffed F.S.R.G and has been moved a bit later in progression as to not serve as a direct sidegrade to the MegaShark
-Nerfed Space Diver Armor's base defense and set bonus: Taking any ammount of damage takes off a small potion of the breath meter in addition, also each pierce gives you -5% damage
-Various changes to crafting recipes, mostly to account for the new items
-The mod name again, because I don't think 'content mod' is really that entricing

--Fixed:
-The Expertise system, it was broken with modded npc types, this will effect your save, and will allow you to get over 15K Expertise now. It was that or your characters get bricked.
-Removed left over debug code on Sword of a Thousand Truths
-A possible crash from hovering over items, maybe
-Murk's treasure bag not dropping the Mudmore
-Fixed FlameTrap Thrower doing stupidly high damage up close
-Super Dart Trap 'gun' not showing crit chance-as it's the only trap-related weapon that can infact, crit.
-Draken talking about Calamity related things while only Boss Checklist is installed, also Draken only talks about a home while he is not homeless
-Murk being marked as beaten in hardmode the first time you kill him
-Netcode related stuff, your javelins shouldn't be desyncing so badly now
-Rebalanced some other things


-Known Bugs
-Netcode not 100% guaranteed to work, I have done some tests here and there to iron out the major issues, but still, problems may arise; be aware.
-FlameTrap Thrower bugs out in Enigma's Etherial; the particles are invisible; this is coming from their side, not mine. As to why I have no idea.
-Dank Shrines can sometimes not grow large enough to have any entrances, also they can generate only the center if they generate inside the temple/dungeon (this has happened, quite alot, thou it's rare and I'll fix it later :/)
-When Caliburn Spirits summon traps, they can possibly break the Sword Alter, now I have added 2 extra blocks on both sides to help buffer this, but it might still happen, so try to not be fighting near the alter in this case.
-Wraiths don't seem to drop the proper materials atm per world

1.02-(2/14/20)-Hot Fix #1:

--Added 'technological' to the beginning of all Sam weapons, this is cosmetic for the time being, but I felt they needed their own special damage text

--Changed the tooltips for all trap weapons that cannot crit: the crit chances doesn't show up
--Removed Hammer Editor, for now
--Fixed a nasty bug that would cause null exception errors when making a new character, whoops!

1.01-(2/13/20)-Changed the mod title to try to make it sound more exciting

1.0-(2/13/20)- Released!
