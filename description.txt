SGA mod is a content mod mostly based around less mundane gameplay, more interesting items from weaponized traps to more techical creations, and tough as nails boss fights; the Dergon will show you the way.
check the forum page for more info as well as a complete list of credits for everyone involved:
Due to the character limit, alot of the changelogs are cut off, checkout out the github linked on the home page for more details
And finally, alot of content in this mod is placeholder sprites due to a lack of active spriters and my inability to make them from scratch, if your a spriter and like what you see, be sure to contact me and we can work something out!

Changelog:

2.21-(3/2/20)-Patch #3:

--Changed:

-Lunar Cascade costs slightly more mana
-Adjusted prices of alot of items
-Because of some changed code, Cirno's homing bolts behave differently
-Damage on some weapons
-Removed most bonus damage off the Grenadier's Glove, this weapon is already very strong for its uses especially now that you can get powerful speed prefixes on thrower items
-Nerfed some of the Dank gear

--Fixed:

-Issues with the Corroded Shield
-Cursed Flame blocks being used in crafting recipes instead of Cursed Flames
-Improving FPS on various projectiles that use nearby enemy/player detection
-Massacre Prototype didn't cost any mana
-Acid Scepter's shots staying in place when you died
-Grenadier's Glove not reciving any bonus velocity from throwing velocity; I tend to forget this one isn't automatically added to throwing weapons


2.2-(2/27/20)-Patch #2:

--Added:
-Acid Scepter, Flail-O-Nades,Demon Steppers, Bundle of Javelin Spear Heads and Javelin Parts, Corroded Shield and Amber Glow Skull (Spider Queen Expert Drop and bonus Drop respectively), Cursed Hail, Massacre Prototype, Heartreach/Booster/Omni Magnets

-Crafting recipes for the SandStorm in a Bottle, Flying Carpet, Slime Staff, and Shark Tooth Necklace

--Changed:
-Opening a Terraria Co Supply Crate now has a chance to drop a Gold Ring, Lucky Coin, and Discount Card
-recipe changes for Bundle of Javelin Bases, Prismal Ore, and Luminary Wings
-Blazewyrm's set bonus explosion has been changed, mostly nerfed
-Omega Sigil is now an accessory, might be overpowered, let me know
-Buffed XOP FlameThrower: Does not cause immunity frames with other projectiles
-Buffed Mudrock Crasher: which got a rework-Nerfed SBC Cannon/Mk2: SBC Cannonballs don't crit, crits on the SBC Cannon and MK2 were honestly way too overpowered given the weapons' low rate of fire and very high damage, however, they ignore enemy immunity frames and the explosion CAN crit
-Spider Queen's Acid Venom has been buffed to do a type of debuff splash damage, this applies to player projectiles too
-Cosmic Cocktail has been reworked-it now ignores immunity frames, projectiles do variable damage, and is slower and does less base damage
-True Moonlight's projectiles hit slightly slower and penetrate less, the movement speed of said projectiles doesn't change, and the weapon charges faster with a quick melee swing speed, Lv3 Slashwave hits less often and homes from a greater distance
-Assassin and Elite Emblem have been reworked as the Omni-Magnet now uses the grab bonus
-Novus, Notchvus, and Dosed arrows have had their homing adjusted
-Starfish Burster's and Starfish Blaster's Starfish projectiles all hit on a target

--Fixed:
-Spider Queen not dropping any Gold
-Accessories that were stackable
-Not really a fix, but updating framework for 1.4, so grenades don't end up doing ranged damage when the update comes
-Being able to Dos enemies in gas who were already combusted
-The F.S.R.G not being able to get crits
-True Moonlight and Surt, the projectiles don't interfer with the melee hits anymore
-Star Burster and Starfish-Burster taking mana when you have no ammo left
-Optimized Homing Arrow code a bit, should lead to better FPS with alot of enemies on screen
-Other smaller bugs

2.11-(2/24/20)-Patch #1b:

This version is the same as below, but I was running into a MariaDB error that kept me from posting, and was debugging it.

2.10-(2/24/20)-Patch #1:

--Changed:
-When Calamity is installed-Doom Harbinger and Surpreme Pinky will automatically force Revengence and Death mode off, this is due to a critical conflict between the mods during these fights
-Enhancing Charm turned out to be alot stronger than it said it was and has been nerfed accordingly
-Normal Difficulty now only gives you 80% of the Expertise when rewarded, while expert mode gives the full ammount
-Removed Draken's lines that talk about him being sorry to Val, because he's not anymore
-Reverse Engineering Station's crafting recipe has been changed a bit, as well as a few other items, but nothing pace breaking
-Lined-out some tooltips to shorten them being too long on lower resolutions
-Crafting recipes for the Heart Lantern and Star in a Bottle Pets have been altered
-Added Glow Masks for a quite a few weapons


--Fixed:
-HOPEFULLY fixed the Sword Shrines getting deleted by generation (atleast the annoying ones, like traps)
-Cosmillash and Beam Gun now do variable damage where they didn't do any before
-Fixed soft-locking issues with the Grenadier's Glove and speed-related modifiers (upped value worth a bit more too to make reforging less cheap)
-Fixed Virulent and Mangrove item crafting issues and adjusted them to require Dank Wood (where needed)
-I forgot to mention a weapon the previous version added- the Circuit Breaker Blade, so yeah, whoops, also updating how I do changelogs numbers by also adding dates.
-A possible issue with Massive Bleeding and Gourged setting the buff type to a different buff
-Typoes and a few other things
