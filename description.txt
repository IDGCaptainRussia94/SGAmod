Changelog:

Changelog 1.02-Hot Fix #1:

--Added 'technological' to the beginning of all Sam weapons, this is cosmetic for the time being, but I felt they needed their own special damage text

--Changed the tooltips for all trap weapons that cannot crit: the crit chances doesn't show up
--Removed Hammer Editor, for now
--Fixed a nasty bug that would cause null exception errors when making a new character, whoops!

Changelog 1.01-Changed the mod title to try to make it sound more exciting


V1: Released!
