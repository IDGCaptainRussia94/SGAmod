SGA mod is a content mod mostly based around less mundane gameplay, more interesting items from weaponized traps to more techical creations, and tough as nails boss fights; the Dergon will show you the way.

What you can expect:

Content from the start all the way to post moonlord
Mini dungeons each with loot, traps, a miniboss, and a reward
10+ bosses with unique AI
2 subclasses of weapon damage: Technological and Trap Damage
200+ items, including many uniquely coded weapons
A Custom Currency that is tied to mod progression
a Dragon NPC!
Some kind of lore is in here, I know it :P

check the forum page for more info as well as a complete list of credits for everyone involved:
Due to the character limit, alot of the changelogs are cut off, checkout out the github linked on the home page for more details
And finally, alot of content in this mod is placeholder sprites due to a lack of active spriters and my inability to make them from scratch, if your a spriter and like what you see, be sure to contact me and we can work something out!

-Weapons being able to cut glass and break pots for no reason

-Alot of netcode related stuff, and to avoid common errors during normal gameplay, however, there's still some issues that I cannot really fix, and summoning Cratrosity/Caliburns might be broken now, my system is "rejecting" net messages for some reason so I cannot test this
